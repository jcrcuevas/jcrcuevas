## API Project for no SQL

I completed an online training under [Zuit Coding Camp](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100069122486134), where we built interactive dashboards using NoSQL databases.
We were taught how to use RapidAPI for integrating real-time data into our projects, retrieving Twitter's current trending topics.
As part of the program, I deployed the final project on GitHub to demonstrate API integration and front-end presentation skills.

## Branding Converter For HTML Email

One of my most valuable contributions in my previous company was developing a **Branding Converter for HTML Email Development** using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Our team often needed to create the same email template for multiple brands, each with unique branding elements like colors, fonts, and logos.

I utilized Jekyll’s templating system and Liquid logic to build a flexible email generator. By simply changing a single variable `brand_name`, the system automatically applied the correct design elements for the selected brand without duplicating the template.

This solution greatly improved our efficiency, reduced human error, and ensured consistency across branded campaigns. It also empowered non-developers to quickly generate brand-specific versions of emails by editing only one line of configuration.

Below is a list of websites I’ve built and maintained as part of these collaborations.
