You’ve landed on the about page of John Cuevas

DIY lover and front-end dev who builds, fixes, codes, and staying fueled with good food.

I didn’t grow up as a techie. I wasn’t the guy who knew keyboard shortcuts or could fix a computer. That started to change in college, when I became curious about tech and started exploring servers, hardware, networking, and structured cabling.

I put in the time to study and even passed the CCNA certification — though I never got to use it professionally.

## Discovering Web Development

Eventually, I found something I truly enjoyed: web development. There's something satisfying about building from scratch and seeing it work. I started learning [HTML](https://html.com), [CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css), and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp), and now I’m exploring [react.js](https://react.dev) to take things further.

One role that really leveled me up was working as an [HTML Email Developer](https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/email-development-best-practices-2). It taught me how tricky email dev can be — with all the client quirks, screen sizes, and layout limitations. But it also sharpened my HTML/CSS skills.

Over time, friends and marketing agencies began asking me for help with web pages, email campaigns, and rendering issues. When budgets are tight, I also build custom tools using Google Apps Script — like automating email workflows or booking systems.

## Tools, Builds & DIY Passion

But I'm not just into code. I love figuring things out and setting things up. I've helped install CCTV systems, built vending machines for WiFi, computer time, and even car washes. If it’s coin-operated, I’ve probably opened it just to see how it works.

## About This Site

This website? I built and published it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I used to rely on WordPress (especially free setups), but constant plugin updates and security issues pushed me to find a better solution.

Enter [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a clean and fast static site generator that works perfectly with GitHub Pages. I forked a theme from [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-hpstr), customized it, and used [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org) for easy content editing.

Now I just write, push, and it’s live no dashboards, no bloat.

## Food, Fun & Life Outside Code

Outside of tech, I love experimenting in the kitchen mostly Asian food with a splash of Italian. Cooking helps me relax and recharge.

I also play badminton with friends whenever I can. It's a great way to unwind and stay active.
