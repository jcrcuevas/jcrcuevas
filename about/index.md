I’m just someone who loves tinkering and doing DIY projects. I didn’t grow up as a techie. I wasn’t the guy who knew keyboard shortcuts or the one who could fix a computer when it stopped working. But that all started to change in college.

That’s when I got curious about tech. I started exploring servers, hardware, networking, and structured cable. I put in the time to study and even passed the CCNA certification though I never really got to use it professionally.

As I kept exploring, I discovered something I really enjoyed: web development. There’s something deeply satisfying about building something from scratch and seeing it work. Play around with [HTML](https://html.com), [CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css), and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp) are my go-to tools. I’m also diving into [react.js](https://react.dev) now to make things smoother and more scalable.

One experience that really helped me grow was working as an [HTML Email Developer](https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/email-development-best-practices-2) for a private company. That role showed me how challenging email development can be with all the quirks of different email clients, varying screen sizes, and layout limitations. It pushed me to improve my HTML and CSS skills. Over time, I started getting asked by friends and a few agencies to help with their email campaigns or troubleshoot rendering issues. And when budgets are tight, I’ve found simple ways to build custom email automation or booking systems using Google Apps Script it’s not fancy, but it works well and gets the job done.

But I’m not just into web development I really enjoy figuring things out and setting things up. I’ve helped friends and neighbors with things like installing CCTV systems, and I’ve also tried building different kinds of vending machines for WiFi access, computer time, and even car washes. If it’s coin-operated, I’ve probably tinkered with it at some point just out of curiosity.

This site you’re on now? I built and published it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I’ve known about it for a while it’s free, stable, and has been around long enough to prove itself. I used to try building on WordPress, especially the free setups, but they came with constant plugin updates and security headaches. For a simple landing page like this, I wanted something lighter and more reliable.

That’s where [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) came in. It’s a static site generator that works great with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Clean, simple, no bloated dashboards. I found a [theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-hpstr) on GitHub, forked the repo, and started tweaking it to match my style. It came with [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org) for the post pages, so editing content was easy. Just write and push. No fuss.

Setting it all up was actually fun. It reminded me why I enjoy building not just for the finished product, but for the process of learning and figuring things out in my own way.

Outside of tech, I’m also into food and cooking. I love experimenting in the kitchen. My go-to dishes? Definitely Asian food, with a bit of Italian mixed in—simple comforts that never get old. Every now and then, I also play badminton with friends. It’s a fun way to stay active and unwind.

At the end of the day, I’m just happy doing what I do. Whether it’s building a website, setting up emails, or working on some weird DIY project, I’m all in. And if you think I can help with something, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m always up for a good project or a fun challenge, let’s build it together!
